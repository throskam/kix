# kix

`kix` is a personal Go module containing a collection of tools, helpers, and conventions I use when working on new Go/HTMX web projects.
It is built on top of **[ki](https://github.com/throskam/ki)** (a routing library) hence the name **kix** (ki + htmx).

## ⚠️ Status & Disclaimer

**This module is not intended for general use.**

- APIs may change without notice
- Documentation may be incomplete or outdated
- Design decisions are optimized for my personal workflow, not for stability or flexibility
- There is no commitment to backward compatibility or support

If you find something useful here, feel free to borrow ideas or copy code, but **do not depend on this module directly** in production or shared projects.
